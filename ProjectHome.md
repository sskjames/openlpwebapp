OpenLP Webapp aims to provide a web interface to the [OpenLP](http://openlp.org) that can be hosted in a central server. By this way it facilitates collaborative lyrics management.

Currently, the application is developed using Python/Django. If you are interested in trying things out all you need to do is to clone the repository and update settings.py with your db details.

WARNING: This project is developed by a person completely new to Python.

You are most welcome though to give your comments, feedback or even contribute to improve this project.

Have a great day!
